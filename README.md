# AWS IAM + Login Monitoring Project (Free Tier Friendly)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
- Set up secure IAM users and groups
- Enforce MFA using policy conditions
- Monitor login events via EventBridge
- Automate IAM setup using AWS CLI
- Stay entirely within AWS Free Tier

## Files
- `mfa_enforced_policy.json` – Denies all actions unless MFA is present
- `create_user.sh` – Bash script to create and assign users
- `eventbridge_rule_console_login.json` – EventBridge rule for detecting console logins without MFA

## Setup Instructions
1. Run `create_user.sh newuser`
2. Apply `mfa_enforced_policy.json` to test user or group
3. Create EventBridge rule using the event pattern in `eventbridge_rule_console_login.json`
4. Link rule to SNS topic to receive email alerts

## Outcome
Demonstrates hands-on IAM security, automation, and threat detection logic for job-readiness in Cloud Support or Security.

## Developer Notes & Learning Curve

### delete_test_user.sh #This script started as a simple AWS CLI test — but through iteration, it became a production-grade IAM user cleanup utility.

Key things I learned:
- AWS doesn't allow IAM users to be deleted unless they are fully detached from groups, policies, and access keys
- Profiles don't own IAM users — they’re just authentication wrappers
- CLI scripting helped me deeply understand IAM dependencies and errors like DeleteConflict
- Building a reusable, safe script required input validation, preview modes, and protection for critical accounts

I plan to revisit this with a Terraform-based approach next, as part of my infrastructure-as-code learning path.
